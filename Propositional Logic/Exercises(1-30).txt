a) True
b) False
c) False
d) False
e) True. (A tautology because the statement is of the form "P if and only if P", where P is "Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone A".This is always true regardless of the specific values, as it states a logical equivalence rather than comparing the actual RAM values.)
Explanation:
This statement is of the form "P if and only if Q," where:
P: "Smartphone A has more RAM than Smartphone B."
Q: "Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone A."
1. If Smartphone A has more RAM than Smartphone B (P is true), then it cannot be true that Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone A (Q is false).
2. If Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone A (Q is true), then it cannot be true that Smartphone A has more RAM than Smartphone B (P is false).
In either case, P and Q cannot both be true at the same time nor can they both be false, because it’s logically impossible for one phone to have more RAM than the other while the reverse is also true.
In an "if and only if" (biconditional) statement, P if and only if Q is true when P and Q have the same truth value—both true or both false.

For proposition e:

P: "Smartphone A has more RAM than Smartphone B."
Q: "Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone A."
Because P and Q are logically opposite statements, they can't both be true simultaneously. However, they can both be false at the same time if the two smartphones have equal RAM. In this case, both P and Q would be false, making P if and only if Q is true.
Summary: Tautologies are true in every case, but if there's generalized(not tautology) if and only if then both must either be true or false. If one part is true and the other is false, the "if and only if" statement is false.

b) True
c) True
d) True -> In logic, a conditional statement with a false antecedent is considered true regardless of the consequent.
e) True.  -> Both parts of the "if and only if" statement are true.

**d) p ∨ q
e) p → q
f) (p ∨ q) ∧ (p → ¬q) ->AND(∧) operator is used when the word "but" is there. The clause that begins with "if" is usually considered the antecedent in these types of sentences.

a) If you have flue, then you miss the final examination.
b) You do not miss the final examination if and only if you pass the course.
c) If you miss the final examination, you do not pass the course.
d) Yoou have the flue, or you miss the final examination, or you pass the course.
**e) Either if you have the flue, then you do not pass the course, or if you miss the final examination, then you do not pass the course.

b) p ∧ ¬q
c) p → q

e) q ∧ ¬p
f) q ∧ ¬p
g) q → p

*16.
a) r ∧ ¬q
b) p ∧ q ∧ r
c) r → p ->This means that if you get an A in the class, then you must have gotten an A on the final.
**d) p ∧ ¬q ∧ r ->In logical terms, "nevertheless" implies a  conjunction symbol.
**e) (p ∧ q) → r ->(When we say 𝐴 implies that B (written A⟹B), we are stating that if A is true, then B must also be true. This is essentially the same as saying A is a sufficient condition for B.) If 𝐴 implies B, then A is a sufficient condition for B. Example: Sufficient Condition: "If it rains (A), then the ground will be wet (B)." Here, "it rains" is a sufficient condition for "the ground will be wet." You can express the same relationship by saying, "If it rains, this implies that the ground will be wet."
**f) r ↔ (q ∨ p)

17.
a) r ∧ ¬p
b) ¬p ∧ q ∧ r
**c) r → (q ↔ ¬p)
d) ¬q ∧ ¬p ∧ r
e) q → (¬r ∧ ¬p) ->Think it using "if then". This means that if hiking is safe, then it must be true that berries are not ripe and grizzly bears have not been seen.
f) (p ∧ r) → ¬q -> Again replace whenever with if and rephrase the sentence. This states that if both conditions are true, then hiking is not safe.

18. For Biconditionals both sides are need to be true. If LHS=RHS then true else false.
a) True
b) False
c) True ->(Left Side: 1+1=3 is false.)(Right Side: "Monkeys can fly" is generally considered false.)(Conclusion: Both sides are false, so the biconditional is true.)
d) False

*19. Only if the clause with the "if"-stament is true then the conclusion(final) is false. In other cases, it is true. A false premise makes the entire conditional true, regardless of the conclusion. (A premise is the sentence with the "if" statement and the conclusion is the other one.)
a) False
b) True
c) True
d) True

20.
a) True ->Premise is false so the statement becomes true.(If premise is false, then no need to look at the conclusion. The answer is then True)
b) True
c) False ->A true premise and a false conclusion make this conditional false.
d) True -> Both the premise and conclusion are true, so the conditional is true.

*21. If both statements in a sentence can be true simutaneously then it is inclusive or otherwise it is exclusive or.
a) Inclusive or -> This suggests that you can have either coffee or tea, or both.
b) Inclusive or -> The requirement could be satisfied by either having three digits, eight characters, or both.
c) Exclusive or -> This implies that you must have taken either one course or the other, but not both, as typically, course prerequisites require one specific condition to be met.
d) Inclusive or ->This indicates that payment can be made in either currency, or both currencies may be accepted together. 

*22.
a) Inclusive or ->This implies that you can have experience in either C++ or Java, or both.
b) Inclusive or ->This suggests that you can have either soup or salad, or both, as part of lunch.
c) Exclusive or ->This indicates that you must present either a passport or a voter registration card to enter the country, but not both.
d) Exclusive or ->This phrase suggests a strict dichotomy: you must publish academic work to maintain your position or face the consequences (like losing your job). The implication is that failing to publish leads to a negative outcome, so you must do one or the other. (While "Publish or perish" may not follow the standard format of a typical propositional statement (like "It is raining"), it conveys a logical relationship and thus qualifies as a propositional statement in a broader sense.

*23.
a) Intended Meaning: Inclusive or is likely intended here, as prerequisites usually allow for flexibility (you can take either course). Inclusive Or: This means that to enroll in discrete mathematics, it is sufficient to have taken either calculus or a course in computer science, or both. In this case, taking both courses would meet the prerequisite. Exclusive Or: This would imply that you can only fulfill the requirement by taking either calculus or a course in computer science, but not both. Taking both would disqualify you from taking discrete mathematics.
b) Intended Meaning: Exclusive or is likely intended here, as promotional offers typically do not allow for receiving both incentives. Inclusive Or: This means that you can choose to receive the $2000 back in cash, or you can opt for the 2% car loan, or you could potentially receive both offers. Exclusive Or: This implies that you can only choose one option; you either get the $2000 back or the 2% loan, but not both at the same time.
c) Intended Meaning: Exclusive or is likely intended here, as menus usually require selecting one of the specific options. Inclusive Or: This would mean you could choose two items from column A, three items from column B, or a combination of both. Exclusive Or: This suggests that you must choose either two items from column A or three items from column B, but not both.
d) Intended Meaning: Inclusive or is likely intended here, as it is common for closures to depend on multiple severe weather conditions. Inclusive Or: This means the school will be closed if either condition is met, or if both conditions happen simultaneously (more than two feet of snow and a wind chill below −100 °F). Exclusive Or: This would imply that the school will only close for one condition at a time; if one condition is met, the other must not be met for the school to be closed.
